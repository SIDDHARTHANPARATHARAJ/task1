DAY 1 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HTTP 1.1 and HTTP 2
                    HTTP stands fo HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL and it is used in client-server
communication.By using HTTP user sends the request to the server and server sends respond to the
server.HTTP 1.1 was created in 1997 and HTTP 2 was created in 2015. 

                    In HTTP 1.1 if we make a request to the sever for .html page and server 
responds to you as a resource of asked .html page, before sending thr request and response there 
is a TCP connection established between client and server.Again we can request to the server and 
the server gives the response.The connection was not lost after the first request because we add a
keep-alive header which is the part of the request so there is a open connection between the server
and the client There is a persistent connection which means several requests and response are 
merged in a single connection.There are some drawbacks that leads to the creation of HTTP 2.The 
first problem is that HTTP 1.1 transfers all the request and response in a plain text messege form.
The second one is head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other request 
untill the response does not recieve all the information related to the header file is repeated in
 every request.

                    HTTP 2 was developed over the SPDY protocol.HTTP 2 works on the binary framing
layer insted of textual that converts all the messeges in binary format.It works on fully 
multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple request.HTTP 2 uses HPACK which is used
to split data from header that compresses the header.The server sends all other files like CSS and 
JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.
